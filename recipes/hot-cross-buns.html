    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        I love hot cross buns and look forward to making these fruity spiced buns every Easter! I like to make the dough in a bread machine, but I have included instructions at the end of this recipe for using a stand mixer.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. water</li>
        <li>2 tsp. milk</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put flour, warm water, 1/4 cup white sugar, egg, egg white, butter, yeast, milk powder, and salt in a bread maker and start on dough program. </li>
        <li>When 5 minutes of kneading are left, add currants and cinnamon. Leave in the machine until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Shape into 12 balls and place in a greased 9x12-inch pan. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from pan immediately and cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
