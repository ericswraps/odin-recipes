    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
